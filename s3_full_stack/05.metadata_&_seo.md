# **5. SEO & Metadata in Next.js**

## **Why SEO and Metadata Matter**

Imagine you built the best **Swiggy clone** — beautiful UI, lightning-fast, all restaurant menus updated daily.
But when people search *"best biryani in Mumbai"* on Google, your site **doesn’t appear anywhere**.

It’s like opening the most amazing restaurant in a hidden alley **with no signboard**.
No matter how good your food is, no one finds it.

This is where **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** and **metadata** come in.
Metadata is the *behind-the-scenes information* that tells **Google, Bing, social media, and browsers**:

* What your page is about
* Who it’s for
* How to display it attractively

If you’ve ever **shared a Zomato restaurant link** on WhatsApp and seen a nice preview with the restaurant’s name, photo, and ratings — that’s **metadata + OpenGraph** in action.

And in **Next.js**, we can manage all of this cleanly using tools like:

* `next/head` — Page titles, descriptions, OpenGraph tags
* **robots.txt** — Tell search engines what to index
* **Sitemap.xml** — Show them the full menu of your pages
* **Canonical URLs** — Avoid duplicate content issues

---

## **`next/head` — Your Metadata Control Room**

### What is it?

`next/head` is a **Next.js component** that lets you put elements inside your HTML `<head>` tag directly from your React component.

Why is this important?
In SEO, the `<head>` section is **prime real estate** — that’s where search engines and social platforms look first.

---

### **Essential Metadata to Include**

1. **Title Tag**
   This is like your app’s name on the Play Store.
   *Groww’s stock page title*:
   `"Tata Motors Share Price Today - Tata Motors Ltd Stock Analysis | Groww"`
   It’s short, descriptive, and has keywords people actually search.

2. **Meta Description**
   Appears under your title in search results.
   Like a **Swiggy restaurant tagline**:
   `"Order delicious biryani from Paradise Restaurant in Hyderabad. Fast delivery, safe packaging."`

3. **OpenGraph Tags (OG)**
   Used by Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc., to generate link previews.
   Without them, your link looks boring.

4. **Twitter Cards**
   Like OG tags, but for Twitter/X — so your Groww IPO page looks good when shared.

5. **Canonical URLs**
   Your official, “this is the main version” link — prevents SEO penalties for duplicate content.

### **Example: Zomato-style Restaurant Page Metadata**

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function RestaurantPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        {/* Basic SEO */}
        <title>Paradise Biryani - Hyderabad | Order Online on CodingGita</title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content="Order authentic Paradise Biryani from Hyderabad on CodingGita. Fast delivery, fresh ingredients, and unbeatable taste."
        />
        <meta name="keywords" content="biryani, Paradise Biryani, Hyderabad food, order online" />

        {/* OpenGraph for social media */}
        <meta property="og:title" content="Paradise Biryani - Hyderabad | Order Online" />
        <meta
          property="og:description"
          content="Taste Hyderabad's legendary Paradise Biryani, now on CodingGita. Order online and get it delivered hot."
        />
        <meta property="og:image" content="https://codinggita.com/images/paradise-biryani.jpg" />
        <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
        <meta property="og:url" content="https://codinggita.com/restaurants/paradise-biryani" />

        {/* Twitter Card */}
        <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
        <meta name="twitter:title" content="Paradise Biryani - Hyderabad" />
        <meta
          name="twitter:description"
          content="Order authentic Paradise Biryani from Hyderabad on CodingGita."
        />
        <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://codinggita.com/images/paradise-biryani.jpg" />

        {/* Canonical URL */}
        <link rel="canonical" href="https://codinggita.com/restaurants/paradise-biryani" />
      </Head>

      <h1>Paradise Biryani - Hyderabad</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

## **Robots.txt — Your Site’s Rulebook for Search Engines**

Think of `robots.txt` as **instructions to delivery partners** — “This lane is blocked, deliver through that one.”

Placed in `public/robots.txt`, it’s read by crawlers like **Googlebot** before they explore your site.

**Example for CodingGita food delivery app:**

```
# Allow all crawlers to index public pages
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Block private pages
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /cart/

# Point to sitemap
Sitemap: https://codinggita.com/sitemap.xml
```

**Best practices:**

* Never block CSS or JS — crawlers need them to render pages.
* Use `Disallow` for admin or private data pages.

---

## **Sitemap.xml — Your Menu Card for Google**

A sitemap is like handing **Google a full restaurant menu** instead of making them guess dishes.

Place it at `/sitemap.xml`.
It lists **every important page** and tells search engines:

* When it was last updated
* How often it changes
* How important it is

**Example:**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://codinggita.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-08-08</lastmod>
    <changefreq>daily</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://codinggita.com/restaurants/paradise-biryani</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-08-08</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

For **big apps** like Swiggy or Zomato:

* Generate **dynamic sitemaps** using API routes, pulling data from your DB.

---

## **Canonical URLs — Declaring the Official Page**

Imagine Zomato has:

* `zomato.com/paradise-biryani`
* `zomato.com/biryani/paradise`

Both show the same content. Without a **canonical tag**, Google thinks you’re duplicating content.

Add in `next/head`:

```jsx
<link rel="canonical" href="https://codinggita.com/restaurants/paradise-biryani" />
```

**Rules:**

* Always use **HTTPS** version.
* Point all duplicates to one **main page**.

---

## **Putting It All Together — Example: Groww Stock Page**

If we were building **Groww’s Tata Motors stock page** on CodingGita:

1. `next/head` → Title: `"Tata Motors Share Price Today | CodingGita Stocks"`, meta description, OG image of the company logo.
2. `robots.txt` → Allow public stock pages, block `/my-portfolio`.
3. `sitemap.xml` → Include this page with priority 0.9.
4. Canonical URL → Always point to `/stocks/tata-motors`.

---

## **Why Next.js Makes This Easier than React CRA**

In **React CRA**, metadata is injected **after JavaScript runs** — crawlers may miss it.
In **Next.js**, metadata is **server-rendered** — crawlers see it instantly.

This is why:

* Swiggy’s restaurant pages load with metadata ready.
* Groww’s stock pages have correct OG previews on social media.

---

✅ Create **a reusable SEO component** so you don’t repeat `<Head>` code.
✅ Use **absolute URLs** for OG images.
✅ Test your metadata using:

* Google’s Rich Results Test
* Facebook Sharing Debugger
* Twitter Card Validator

---

## **Conclusion**

When you combine:

1. **Accurate metadata (`next/head`)**
2. **Clear crawling rules (`robots.txt`)**
3. **Complete site maps (`sitemap.xml`)**
4. **Duplicate control (canonical URLs)**

… you’re not just building a site — you’re **opening your restaurant on the busiest street in town with bright lights, big signs, and beautiful menu boards.**

With **Next.js**, you get all the SEO benefits of SSR + the flexibility to control metadata per page.
